// Basically, given a user look at the tracker to get a list of peers.
// Then, iterate through that list of peers and look to see if they have the 
// specific piece that tbe user needs.
// If they do, then start a new thread that connects / handshakes through FTP to
// download that piece. 
// Keep looking at the pieces that peer has available until you either hit the limit of 
// pieces you can download simultaneously, or hit the download limit.
